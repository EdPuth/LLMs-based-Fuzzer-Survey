# LLMs-based-Fuzzer-Survey
This repo list the core literature in the field of fuzzing tests, large language models, and LLM-based fuzzer. Most of the papers are selected from authoritative platforms such as Google Scholar, and were published recently. It will be helpful for researchers who want to develop LLMs-based fuzzer.
